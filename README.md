### Preface

The reason for developing this plug-in is that the darkrp server I play is often maintained. As a result, players have to lose the progress of their work.

With this plug-in, we can make appropriate compensation for every player after maintenance.

### Explain

Because it is a very simple plug-in, it is not multilingual and its language is Chinese.

I sorry for foreign developers.
